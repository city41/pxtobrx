Up and running at [http://pxtobrx.com](http://pxtobrx.com)

A simple webapp that creates instructions on how to build Lego mosaics for video game sprites.

## Hacking on the site

The site was built using [react-starter-kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit).

### To get a local dev environment going

1. clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `gulp`

Your browser will open with a window pointed at http://localhost:3000

Any time you save a file, the browser will reload with your changes

## Deploying

To build a release build do `gulp build --release`, then from there, `build/public/` will contain everything needed to push out to gh-pages.

## Contributing
